# Volt Suggestions

This is a Discord Bot made in Discord.js, it allows to create a Discord Webhook in a channel, by a command from the admins.
The users interact with an emoji, then the bot will send a message to them.
After replying to the bot (if this happens in less than 120 seconds) the bot will send a Webhook in another channel.
Users can react to the suggestions and Admins can decide wether accept or deny the suggestion.
